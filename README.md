Full software to control an adafruit gps shield

I modified Adafruit's GPS library for this project, the gzipped tarball is at the root.

Known bugs:

    Every thing needs more testing: but most notably the SD backup features,
    the power saving feature (deep sleep)
    Missing feature: turn the LCD completely off to save power.
    No description of the physical circuit (wiring etc...) Be patient ;-)
